# Wasset.Tour– Full Stack Web Application 

**Revolutionizing Syrian Tourism Through Seamless B2B Service Integration**

Wasset.Tour is a full-stack web-based tourism platform designed to connect travelers with tourism service providers in Syria. The platform enables users to explore, compare, and evaluate restaurants, hotels, tour guides, and transportation services based on price and quality.

The project was developed in two phases:

Phase 1: Frontend development using React

Phase 2: Backend development with authentication and database integration

This project addresses the lack of centralized, modern tourism platforms in Syria and aims to support both tourists and local service providers.
